Unfortunately, not all in the industry are registered. Not entirely illegal, many unregistered brokers populate the financial markets.&nbsp; Extra precaution is suggested for individuals and companies when they deal with forex brokers. <br><br>The United States has passed a federal law, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 that gives authority to the commission to investigate suspicions of frauds in the transactions. <br><br>Frauds in Forex trading have telltale signs and you must be aware of these. Be wary of schemes that offer quick riches.&nbsp; An experienced Forex brokers will tell you currency trading is not a risk free business and only those with real analytical methods can succeed in the field. And, even when projections seem sound, there is no way of telling exactly how strong a currency will hold out against many factors. So watch out for those who promise large profits no matter the economic condition is.&nbsp; <br><br>Most brokers ask for margin investments. If you are not fully aware of how this works, do not venture into it. You may be losing s more than you earn in the long run. Beware also of the “interbank market” service that brokers may offer. In reality, only large banks, corporations and investment institutions have access to this loose network of currency traders.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>To be sure about the credibility of the brokers you are getting, study their profiles and company background seriously and extensively. Stick with a shortlist of firms that are registered with the regulatory commission on commodity futures.<br><br><br><br>
