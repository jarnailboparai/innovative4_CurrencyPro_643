  <div align="center">How to Use Them to Make Massive Profits<br><div align="left"><br></div></div>Here we have related Bollinger bands to the currency markets (as it is here that they are most useful) - but they are useful in all financial markets.<br>Bollinger bands will help you to predict big trending moves, act on big trend reversals and finally, time trading positions with greater accuracy for bigger profits.<br><br>Here we have related Bollinger bands to the currency markets (as it is here that they are most useful) - but they are useful in all financial markets.<br><br>What are Bollinger Bands?<br><br>Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger bands are volatility bands drawn around a simple moving average.<br><br>You calculate Bollinger bands using the standard deviation of price over the same period as moving averages and plotted as lines above and below the moving average.<br><br>As moving averages have been traditionally used to identify the underlying trend, Bollinger bands combine this with the volatility of the individual market (or the standard deviation) – to plot a trading envelope.<br><br>The distance between upper and lower Bollinger bands reflects the volatility of the market traded.<br><br>As prices force themselves away from the longer-term average, the standard deviation rises - and thus the bands will fluctuate in varying amounts, away from the average.<br><br>Why Bollinger Bands Work<br><br>In any market, the value of currency traded tends to rise slowly over the longer term.<br><br>Prices may spike short term, but will normally dip back to the longer term moving average (the centre band) - which represents realistic value.<br><br>The volatility of the outer bands therefore gives us an indication of how volatile prices are - and how far away price is from longer-term value.<br><br>Most price spikes are caused as much by trader psychology, as the supply and demand backdrop - and this scenario is reflected in the concept of Bollinger bands.<br><br>Why are Bollinger Bands so useful?<br><br>Bollinger bands perform three major functions for traders:<br><br>1. Spotting a Breakout and New Trend<br><br>Markets move between low volatility trading ranges, to high volatility trending moves.<br><br>When a market makes trades in a narrow range, the Bollinger bands will narrow together and this shows a market with extremely low volatility - however this is a warning that a high volatility trending move is likely to follow.<br><br>When prices break above or below the upper or lower band, it is an indication that a breakout and trend is about to develop - traders will then take a position in the direction of the breakout, and try to ride the trend.<br><br>2. Timing Entry Levels in a Trend<br><br>We all know long term currency trends last for months or years - but we need to get in at the best risk / reward level.<br><br>Bollinger bands will help get you in to the trend and time your entry.<br><br>All you do is watch for dips toward the centre band - and enter in the direction of the trend - it really is that simple!<br><br>To time your entries with greater accuracy, and filter out “false” breaks we recommend using a momentum indicator - such as stochastics, to confirm the move.<br><br>3. Spotting Market Reversals<br><br>When the price touches the top of the band, a sell is generated, and prices should revert back to mean, or the middle moving average band.<br><br>If the price touches the bottom of the band, traders can buy a currency, assuming that it is oversold, and will rally back towards the top of the band.<br><br>The spacing, or width of the band, is dependent on the volatility of the market, but gives traders a clear indication of where prices will go, and when to enter.<br><br>A Word of Caution!<br><br>Bollinger bands are a useful tool - but need combining with other indicators, as with any single indicator, they should not be used in isolation.<br><br>We personally feel Bollinger bands should be used with basic charting, to get the big picture - and the best timing indicator is the stochastic as stated, to filter out “false” signals<br>
